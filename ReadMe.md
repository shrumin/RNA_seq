RNA Seq analysis

This repository shows higher level analysis of RNA-seq data. The data used for this analysis has been uploaded in the data folder.RNASeq data of blood was collected from 14 healthy controls(HC), 14 patients with Common cold(CC) and 14 patients with Flu(FLU).In the data folder there will be an expression matrix, differential expression files.

Significant genes folder contain the list of significant genes in when compared across conditions like CC_vs_HC,FLU_vs_HC,CC_vs_FLU.The significant genes were filtered out based on the abolute(log fold change) > 1 and p adjusted < 0.05. In this folder, a master table is present which conatins an overall view the entire set of genes(including non significant ones).

The plots generated by the assi2.R script are in the plots folder
